# Project Plan

## Phase 0 - Discovery

- Define target frequency range and detection goals.
- Select RF modules and MCU candidate list.
- Define power budget and battery target.

## Phase 1 - Architecture + Prototype (v0.1)

- Build bench prototype with 1 RF module + MCU.
- Implement basic sweep + spectrum view.
- Validate sweep rate and detection thresholds.

## Phase 2 - Multi-module Integration (v0.2)

- Expand to multiple RF chains.
- Add multi-antenna switching or parallel capture.
- Improve UI and logging.

## Phase 3 - Field Prototype (v0.3)

- Portable enclosure.
- Battery optimization.
- Field testing and calibration.

## Phase 4 - ML/AI Assist (v1.0+)

- Dataset collection.
- Model evaluation and inference pipeline.

## Risks and mitigations

- RF module availability: maintain alternate sources.
- Power budget: early measurement, optimize processing.
- UI performance: prioritize efficient rendering.
