# Vision

## Product summary

BB-ScaRF is a handheld, battery/USB-powered broadband RF scanner with multiple antennas and parallel RF modules, orchestrated by a central MCU. The device scans, detects, characterizes, and visualizes RF activity across a target frequency range. Future versions add ML/AI-assisted signal analysis and RF signature recognition.

## Goals

- Rapid, portable RF situational awareness for field use.
- Parallel scanning to reduce sweep time and improve detection.
- Clear, actionable UI with sensible presets and expert modes.
- Modular RF front-end to support different band coverage.
- Extensible firmware and data pipeline to support ML/AI later.

## Non-goals (v0.x)

- Full RF compliance testing tool (spectrum analyzer replacement).
- High-precision lab-grade calibration.
- On-device ML training; inference only is considered later.

## Target users

- RF technicians and field engineers.
- Hobbyists and makers working on RF projects.
- Security and signal hunting enthusiasts.

## Success criteria (v0.1)

- Detect common RF sources in target bands with repeatable results.
- Sweep time within the acceptable range for field usage.
- Battery life sufficient for a field session.
- Usable UI to scan, pause, zoom, and log.
