# BB-ScaRF (Broad Band Scanner RF)

Handheld, battery/USB-powered RF scanning device with multiple antennas, parallel RF modules, and a central MCU to control subsystems, analyze signals, and present results. Future versions should incorporate ML/AI-based signal analysis and RF signature recognition.

## Next steps

1) Confirm scope for v0.1 (bands, sensitivity, UI/UX, enclosure size).
2) Identify RF front-end and MCU candidates.
3) Decide on first prototype architecture and test setup.
